# **Relative Clause**

A **Relative Clause** is a subordinate clause that **provides additional information about a noun**. It starts with a **relative pronoun** (_who, which, that, whose, where, when_, etc.).

## 🔹 **1. Types of Relative Clauses**

There are **two types** of relative clauses:

### ✅ **1. Defining Relative Clause**

- **Defines** the noun; without it, the sentence **loses its meaning**.
- **No commas are used**.

📌 **Examples:**

- _The boy **who is wearing a red shirt** is my brother._
- _The book **that I borrowed from you** is interesting._

🔹 **Relative Pronouns in Defining Clauses:**

| Relative Pronoun | Meaning             | Example                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **who**          | for people          | _The girl **who sits next to me** is my friend._        |
| **which**        | for things, animals | \*I love the car **which my dad bought.\***             |
| **that**         | for people, things  | _The movie **that we watched** was great._              |
| **whose**        | possession          | _The man **whose phone was stolen** called the police._ |
| **where**        | place               | \*This is the cafe **where we met.\***                  |
| **when**         | time                | \*I remember the day **when we first met.\***           |

📌 **Important! In spoken English, "that" often replaces "who" and "which".**

### ✅ **2. Non-defining Relative Clause**

- Adds **extra** information, but the sentence **makes sense without it**.
- **Separated by commas**.
- **"That" cannot be used**.

📌 **Examples:**

- _My mother, **who is 50 years old**, loves gardening._
- _London, **which is the capital of the UK**, is very expensive._

🔹 **Difference between defining and non-defining clauses:**
✔ _The students **who study hard** pass the exams._ (**Defining** – specifies **which** students.)  
✔ _The students, **who study hard**, pass the exams._ (**Non-defining** – implies **all** students study hard.)

---

## 🔹 **2. When Can a Relative Pronoun Be Omitted?**

A relative pronoun can be omitted if it **is not the subject** of the clause:

✔ _The book **(that) I bought** is great._ ("that" can be omitted)  
✔ _The woman **(who) I met** was very kind._ ("who" can be omitted)

However, if the pronoun is **the subject**, it **cannot be omitted**:

❌ _The boy **is wearing a red shirt** is my brother._ ("who" cannot be omitted)  
✔ _The boy **who is wearing a red shirt** is my brother._

## **🔹 Conclusion:**

A **Relative Clause** is used to specify information about a noun.

- **Defining clauses** – essential, **no commas**.
- **Non-defining clauses** – optional, **separated by commas**.
- **"That" cannot be used in non-defining clauses**.
- **A relative pronoun can be omitted if it is not the subject**.
