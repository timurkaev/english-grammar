## 🔹 **1. Formation of Past Simple**

Formula:  
✅ **[Subject] + [verb in past form] + [rest of the sentence]**

| Subject       | Affirmative    | Negative                      | Question          |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **I**         | I **worked**   | I **did not (didn’t) work**   | **Did** I work?   |
| **You**       | You **worked** | You **did not (didn’t) work** | **Did** you work? |
| **He/She/It** | He **worked**  | He **did not (didn’t) work**  | **Did** he work?  |
| **We/They**   | We **worked**  | We **did not (didn’t) work**  | **Did** we work?  |

📌 **Important!**

- In **affirmative sentences**, regular verbs take the **-ed** ending (_work → worked_).
- In **questions and negatives**, the auxiliary verb **did** is used, and the **main verb remains in its base form** (_Did you work?_).
