## 🔹 **1. Formation of Present Continuous**

Formula:  
**am / is / are + verb + -ing**

| Subject       | Affirmative         | Negative                | Question             |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **I**         | I **am working**    | I **am not working**    | **Am** I working?    |
| **You**       | You **are working** | You **are not working** | **Are** you working? |
| **He/She/It** | He **is working**   | He **is not working**   | **Is** he working?   |
| **We/They**   | We **are working**  | We **are not working**  | **Are** we working?  |

> 🔹 **Contractions:**

- I am → **I’m**
- He is → **He’s**
- You are → **You’re**
- I am not → **I’m not**
- He is not → **He isn’t**
